//Chapter 5 Exercise 7:
// *
// *      (Financial application: compute future tuition)
// *      Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and
// *      increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition will be $10,500.
// *      Write a program that computes the tuition in ten years and the total
// *      cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth year.
